        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I am a third year student attending my degree in CSE at Presidency University Bangalore. I've done my PUC at GCIS Pre University College Bangalore.
            I am enthusiastic about learning new things. I always like to keep tabs on new tech emerging daily and get to know more about those. <br>
            I am a natural leader. Unlike many others, I blend strong analytical thinking with real world leadership experience, allowing me to solve problems and also lead people to a vision.

            <div><h3>Arduino Project:</h3>
            Made a Laser Security System using Arduino. <br>The setup was comprised of a single laser module and mirrors to bounce the
            laser beam off so as to reach the sensor. If the beam is disrupted, an alarm would be raised. 
        </div>
        <div><h3>Raspberry Pie Project:</h3>
        Developed a Wildlife Security Detection and Monitoring System which consisted of mainly a camera module and a raspberry pie board. <br>
        The camera would be having motion sensors which would be pre loaded with algorithms consisting of a pre defined set of animals to detect them and notify that the animal (name) was detected, and shows the live feed.
